This project is an attempt to develop a publicly available parser which can parse Android's binary XML. <u>AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool) encodes/decodes XML resources in Google's own proprietary binary XML format</u>. It's a common believe that this is a generic WBXML format and any WBXML capable parser can parse it. But this is not true.

If you are planning to explore Android's Binary XML, my code base can help you to start and build service on top of it.

**Version 1.0**- is capable of parsing Android Manifest, XML layouts etc. and converting DEX/ODEX to CLASS, which can be opened by any de-compiler.
